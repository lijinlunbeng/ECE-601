When I use a PC or laptop, it's the API that moves data between programs.
And the Twitter API saves a lot of time. 
I used Tweepy to grab the data in this project. 
In the captured project data, we can grab any Twitter user's data at will. 
In my results, I just grabbed the Twitter data of a Korean actress, from which I could observe a lot of information, such as her various hobbies.
In general, this saves us programmers the ability to crawl data directly through third-party apis.
