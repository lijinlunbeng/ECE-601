The first and most complex step is to provide an environment in which we can use this experiment accurately.

1. As a first step, I downloaded anaconda because it's a great way to convert python from one version to another, especially for this task.
By the way, anaconda is a vitual environment for a python complier. This was a project last year, and a lot of things couldn't implement our project because of the newer format. I really recommand we could use python 3.6 or 3.7 version.
If you were use python 3.8 or above this verision, some packages, like tensorflow, you have to downgrade or unstall it. Although there are some complex issues, I still used python 3.8. 

2. Download a software named Unity. Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine.
Hence, we used this platfrom to build a game environment we want.

3. Donload our important mlagents packages. This package includes some game agents to achieve our goal.

4. I picked up a agents named 3D ball.
