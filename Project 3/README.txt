Project 3

This project applies to machine learning and has interesting practical applications in a game. All the open source projects come from this site ï¼šhttps://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.
and thanks to the work of the developers, I plan to implement their latest seventh generation product in this project.

This project is very suitable for students who are new to machine AI learning, and I have learned a lot from it. It seems like a very complex project, but it's very useful for us to understand and understand how robots work and give them the ability to learn. In this sharing, I will actually use this machine learning, and put the experimental results of a game in this file. In addition, I will describe in details how I conducted this experiment.
